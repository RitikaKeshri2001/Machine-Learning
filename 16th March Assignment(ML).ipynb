    "Q2: How can we reduce overfitting? Explain in brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning, where a model becomes too \n",
    "    complex and starts to fit the training data too well, resulting in poor \n",
    "    generalization to new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Ways to reduce overfitting are:\n",
    "    1. Use simpler models: \n",
    "    A way to reduce overfitting is to use simpler models, such as linear regression \n",
    "    or decision trees, instead of more complex models like neural networks. Simpler \n",
    "    models are less likely to overfit because they have fewer parameters to tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Train with more data\n",
    "    With the increase in the training data, the crucial features to be extracted become \n",
    "    prominent. The model can recognize the relationship between the input attributes and \n",
    "    the output variable. The only assumption in this method is that the data to be fed \n",
    "    into the model should be clean; otherwise, it would worsen the problem of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Regularization: \n",
    "    Regularization is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function of the model, \n",
    "    which encourages the model to have smaller weights. This can help to prevent overfitting \n",
    "    by reducing the complexity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Early stopping\n",
    "    This method aims to pause the model's training before memorizing noise and random \n",
    "    fluctuations from the data. There can be a risk that the model stops training too soon, \n",

    "    train. \n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Dropout: \n",
    "    Dropout is a technique that randomly drops out some of the neurons in the model during \n",

    "Q4: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning. What is the relationship between bias and\n",

    "\n",
    "    The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that relates \n",
    "    to the balance between model complexity and its ability to generalize well to new data. \n",
    "    In essence, the bias-variance tradeoff refers to the relationship between the bias and \n",
    "    variance of a model and how they affect its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bias:\n",
    "    The bias is known as the difference between the predicion of the values by the ML model\n",
    "    and the correct value. Being high in biasing gives a large error in training as well as \n",
    "    testing data. Its recommended that an algorithm should always be low biased to avoid the\n",
    "    problem of underfitting. By high bias, the data predicted is in a straight line format,\n",
    "    thus not fitting accurately in the data in dataset. Such fitting is known as Underfitting\n",
    "    of Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variance:\n",
    "    The variability of model prediction for a given data point which tells us spread of our\n",
    "    data is called the variance of the model. The difference in the accuracy of a machine \n",
    "    learning model's predictions between the training data and the test data is referred \n",
    "    to as variance. The model with high variance has a very complex fit to the training \n",
    "    data and thus is not able to fit accurately on the data which it hasnâ€™t seen before. \n",
    "    As a result, such models perform very well on training data but has high error rates \n",
    "    on test data. When a model is high on variance, it is then said to as Overfitting of \n",
    "    Data. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Bias-Variance tradeoff in machine learning:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    The bias-variance tradeoff can be visualized as a U-shaped curve, where the total error \n",
    "    (i.e., the sum of bias and variance) initially decreases as the model becomes more complex \n",
    "    and can better fit the training data (i.e., lower bias), but then increases again as the \n",
    "    model becomes too complex and starts to overfit the training data (i.e., higher variance).\n",
    "    For any model, we have to find the perfect balance between Bias and Variance. This just \n",

    "\n",
    "    The relationship between bias and variance can be illustrated by the bias-variance tradeoff. \n",
    "    As the complexity of the model increases, the bias typically decreases and the variance \n",

    "    Methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting in ML are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Plotting learning curves: \n",

    "    model as a function of the number of training examples or the training time. \n",
    "    If the training error is much lower than the validation error, it is a sign \n",
